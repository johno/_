In Frank Chimero's book, [Shape of Design](https://shapeofdesignbook.com/chapters/03-improvisation-and-limitations/),
I came across a haiku by Yosa Buson that really struck me.

> _Lighting one candle_ <br /> > _with another candle—_ <br /> > _spring evening._
>
> _— Yosa Buson_

Frank Chimero summarized it eloquently:

> Buson is saying that we accept the light contained in the work of others without darkening their efforts. One candle can light another, and the light may spread without its source being diminished. We must sing in our own way, but with the contributions and influence of others, we need not sing alone.

Being a complete fucking nerd I naturally go straight
for the parallels in open source. Not everything in OSS
is perfect, in fact it's far from it, but one can easily
argue that a lot of innovation has been built on the
foundation of open source.

New projects can draw from the past of what already exists
and use that to start fresh. The flame dancing on the
candle wick represents previous innovations and fundamental
advancements. The other candle is the fresh start that
can learn from the past and isn't beholden to legacy
decisions.

However, the last line of the poem left me scratching my
head. What on earth does "spring evening" mean?

After some deliberation I took it simply. The spring
evening is the event that requires the candles to provide
light. Spring is typically a season associated with
excitement and late nights after long winters.

A birth of a new project is much like a calm spring
night that's welcoming summer. Full of promise and
hope, much like a new open source project.

## Open source is full of remixes

This is a great thing. Every "candle that I light"
has been lit by other projects either through
inspiration or through actual code.

It's the engine of open source.

And I think that's a great thing. After all, we're
all standing on the shoulders of giants. Spring
evening.
