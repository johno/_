Monorepos are a great way to be more productive when developing software
and apps because everything is in one place and packages are automatically
linked. This is particularly beneficial when you want to make sweeping changes
to a bunch of related packages or update tooling.

We're all happier together.

In the node ecosystem, the tooling is decent. Yarn workspaces are pretty seamless
and Just Work. This allows you to interlink your packages locally during development.
However, when a project consists of multiple packages that are meant to be published
and consumed by users you still need to handle versioning and a changelog.

Over time I'd grown a bit frustrated with the tool in vogue, Lerna. A lot of my
initial qualms were addressed over time (it's continually getting better and better),
but I never liked the fact that the notion of a changelog was treated as a separate
concern. Additionally, contributors to a project could never signify intent around
how their changes affect semver.

In fact, those that wanted to signify intent would often manually change the version
in `package.json` files. As a maintainer, you can appreciate their prudence, but it
always required you to back out that change because the tooling will automatically
handle the version bump.

Additionally, other changelog generation tools use GitHub releases which I've
never fully gotten on board with because it's too coupled to GitHub and isn't
represented in the code itself.

Enter [changesets](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets).

I was a bit skeptical at first (surprise), but was on board to give the tool a shot
because it directly addressed versioning and changelogs _together_ which was something
that always felt askew to me.

I became a Happy User very quickly.

Where changesets really shines is when managing a long running branch with a large
collection of changes. Think of the big "v2" where you have a bunch of PRs collecting
in your v2 branch. Each contribution can contain its own changeset which a contributor
can generate and describe the change.

These all end up in a directory as markdown files.

On release, the changesets get gobbled up and end up in a single collection of version changes
across the monorepo with a changelog for each package. Version management, publishing, and changelog
generation together. Happy!

That's not all though, changesets has a "but wait, there's more".

Changesets also comes with a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/changesets/action) and
a [GitHub bot](https://github.com/changesets/bot) to further automate maintainer
tasks around handling versioning and publishing.

The changeset bot ensures that changes come with a changeset, and if the contributor didn't
add one it will comment on the issue. This serves as a friendly reminder to a contributor
to add a changeset while also making it easier on maintainers because they can click
a quick link and add the changeset in themselves without leaving the GitHub UI.

My favorite part, though, is the GitHub Action that changesets offers. When you merge a
changeset into master, the GitHub Action will automatically open up a PR that runs
`changesets version` for you. As you merge in multiple PRs for a release it will continually
update the PR and handle versions and changeset generation so you don't have to run
the command locally.

You can additionally add a publish step. This will, when you merge the changeset version PR
into master, run the build step and then publish the new versions. So, as a maintainer,
you don't even have to run the versioning and publish locally.

It's pretty dreamy. I'm a changesets convert.
