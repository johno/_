For most low-level use cases you might have in Gatsby, there will already be a
plugin, but sometimes you want to extend it with a specific need.
Since Gatsby plugins are node modules, you can extend existing packages
in a straightforward way.

## Why would you do this?

Extending an existing plugin that performs a non-trivial task is useful
because you can avoid duplicating the library's code and opt in to bug
fixes down the road. Many plugins often only expose a lifecycle function
or two so you can proxy them along and layer in new functionality.

## Real world use case

Most of my site's built with Gatsby have a need to be able to set redirects.
This is a bit tricky if you're not using a static host (like Netlify) which
handles them for you. For example, if you're using GitHub Pages you will
have to write an HTML file that performs the redirect:

```html
<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; URL='/new-url/'" />
```

Naturally, there's a plugin, [gatsby-plugin-meta-redirect](https://github.com/getchalk/gatsby-plugin-meta-redirect)
that does this. Though for my use case I want to add a bit more functionality.
I want to be able to also declare a `redirects.json` file where I can specify
all the redirects I want to have created in the root directory. To achieve
this I began building a plugin, [gatsby-plugin-redirects](https://github.com/johno/gatsby-plugin-redirects),
to do this.

### New functionality

For my desired functionality I can expose a [`createPages`](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/node-apis/#createPages)
lifecycle method, check for the existence of the file, and then call
[`createRedirect`](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/actions/#createRedirect) for
each entry:

```js
// gatsby-node.js
const fs = require('fs')

const FILE_NAME = './redirects.json'

const fileExists = filePath => {
  try {
    if (fs.existsSync(filePath)) {
      return true
    }
  } catch (_) {
    return false
  }
}

exports.createPages = ({ actions }) => {
  const { createRedirect } = actions

  if (fileExists(FILE_NAME)) {
    const redirects = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(FILE_NAME, 'utf8'))

    redirects.map(redirect => {
      createRedirect({
        fromPath: redirect.from,
        toPath: redirect.to,
        isPermanent: true
      })
    })
  }
}
```

This is nice, however, it still doesn't handle the creation of the HTML
pages that `gatsby-plugin-meta-redirect` does. I also don't want to have
to install both plugins and add to my gatsby-config. So this is where we
can proxy the meta redirect plugin functionality.

### Extending a plugin

To do this I add the plugin as a dependency:

```sh
yarn add gatsby-plugin-meta-redirect
```

Then import the lifecycle method that it uses and export it directly:

```js
const { onPostBuild } = require('gatsby-plugin-meta-redirect/gatsby-node')

// ...

export.onPostBuild = onPostBuild
```

Now, `redirects.json` is read in and static, HTML redirects are created
for each entry.

## Conclusion

Now I have a simple library I can share amongst my projects that requires
a quick workflow to get up and running:

- `yarn add gatsby-plugin-redirects`
- Add plugin to `gatsby-config.js`
- Create a `redirects.json` file
