After hearing folks talk a lot about "knowledge graphs"
it finally clicked for me when playing around with
[Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com). Being able
to seamlessly interlink other pages, and automatically
create new ones from your current context, is really
powerful.

This really resonated with me. I'd recently finished up
a Notion setup that I thought was the the way for me to
finally implement my digital garden.

But something felt broken. In order to start writing I
found myself wondering:

- Where should I put this?
- Is it notes? Is it a journal? Is it a blog post?

It was a surprising amount of cognitive overhead. Sure,
I could just start writing somewhere and move it later.
That's what I was doing.

But I realized my personal CMS of content and thoughts wasn't
exactly "relational" or "hierarchical".
[It's a graph](https://twitter.com/4lpine/status/1208594869653925889).

Roam got me writing down thoughts way more quickly, again.

But, there were small things that I wanted to be different.
The editor itself was pretty clunky. Using custom syntax
for the graph linking was weird. It wasn't open source.

There isn't a baked in API and publish workflow.

And there was one large, fundamental issue. I want something
MDX-based.

This is where I think our work on [Sector](https://sector.tools)
will be interesting because I think MDX will open up lots
of doors while still allowing us to avoid custom syntax.

Graph linking will be a Markdown link. Something like:

```md
[My doc](https://sector.tools/g/123-456-abc-def)
```

When "publishing" this can be automatically transformed
to a local slug with a [remark plugin](https://github.com/remarkjs).

We can also avoid rigid content modeling by querying
information from within a document. Markdown/MDX has a
lot of structural information in it. We can also potentially
assign user-defined labels or identifiers to individual
blocks of a document.

This would allow queries that might look like:

```gql
{
  document(id: 'johno/posts/hello-world') {
    title: block(element: 'h1') {
      text,
      md,
      mdx,
      html
    },
    tagline: block(id: 'tagline') {
      text
    }
  }
}
```

I've also been doing some thinking about how to build
a ["local first"](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first.html)
version of Markdown graphs. Hypothetically a UUID could
be added to the frontmatter. This would be able to be connected
locally (allowing slugs to change over time) and have a
transform step that changes UUID links to the slug of a document.

I'm absolutely sold on this idea of graphs for digital
gardens. It's an important aspect because it's so common
to reference prior writing.

Yet, right now, I'm not referencing prior blog posts I've
written that are relevant. Because, it's too manual and
I'm lazy.
