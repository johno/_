Over the past few months I've gotten much more deliberate
around how I'm organizing my posts. Here's a rough breakdown
of my workflow.

## Hand curation

One of the most important pieces for me is hand-curating my
writing index page. I change this pretty frequently based on
my mood. It's fluid.

## Pagination? Nope.

There are three primary "index pages" on my blog. The first
is the main, hand curated writing page. The second is the archive
which is a chronological listing of all posts. The last is each
tag page.

These are all grouped already, and as such I don't see a need
for any type of pagination. As such, it's easier to search and
each listing is already "scoped" based on context.

## Full archive

I also expose an entire writing archive in chronological order
for folks that want to peruse things more linearly or even just
browse stuff that I've written.

I use this myself even since some of my posts are sort of initial
spikes around a topic I plan on revisiting before I add it to a
curated topic.

### What about really old posts?

In my `content/posts` directory I also have an `archives` dir which
I use to house posts that are old or abandoned. "Active posts" are
in the topmost directory and might be edited again.

## Tags

For posts I add tags pretty liberally and use
[gatsby-theme-blog-tags](https://npmjs.com/package/gatsby-theme-blog-tags) to
generate tag pages. Right now I don't link to tag pages but plan
on using them for linking to curated topics as my content broadens.

## Dates?

Following behind [Joel's footsteps](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden)
I don't add dates to my posts. The vast majority are evergreen and
iterated on to keep them relevant.

## Conclusion

I don't understand our obsession with chronological content. After
tucking away my posts index (and referenced as an archive) it helped
me better think about how to organize my writing.

I'm still tweaking things but feel like I'm honing in on something
that makes sense for me.
