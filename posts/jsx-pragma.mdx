For a lot of us building for the web, whether you're using
React, Preact, Vue, Emotion, MDX, or another library that
uses JSX you've been using a JSX pragma. Possibly without
ever realizing it!

In Computer Science speak it's a "directive" that tells a
compiler how to handle the input.

In Ruby, you can do something like:

```rb
# coding: UTF-8

def foo
  :bar
end
```

The `key: value` notation is used by the Ruby interpreter.
The above tells Ruby to use UTF-8 encoding.

In JavaScript, outside the context of JSX, there's a
"pragma" to use strict mode: `"use strict"`.

## Back to JSX

Babel now supports JSX by default and will transform
JSX to the proper function call. In a React project,
the following JSX:

```js
const TomatoBox = (
  <div
    style={{
      backgroundColor: 'tomato',
      padding: '20px'
    }}
  >
    I'm Tomato!
  </div>
```

Would result in:

```js
const TomatoBox = React.createElement(
  "div",
  {
    style: {
      backgroundColor: "tomato",
      padding: "20px"
    }
  },
  "I'm Tomato!"
)
```

This occurs because most projects will use
[`@babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx`](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-react-jsx)
which sets a default pragma of `/* jsx React.createElement */`.
That's why we end up with the `React.createElement` function
call.

### Changing the pragma

When babel transpiles JSX it checks for a pragma,
or directive, which might look like:

```js
/* jsx h */
const TomatoBox = (
  <div
    style={{
      backgroundColor: 'tomato',
      padding: '20px'
    }}
  >
    I'm Tomato!
  </div>
```

Even using `@babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx`, we'd result
in `h()` function calls because it takes precedence during
babel's transpilation.

```js
const TomatoBox = h(
  "div",
  {
    style: {
      backgroundColor: "tomato",
      padding: "20px"
    }
  },
  "I'm Tomato!"
)
```

## Conclusion

Often times the "Computer Science" speak doesn't make it easy
to parse what's actually happening. Sometimes using simpler
words is better. I'll go with:
