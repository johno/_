# Newsletter

If you're interested in what I have to say or what I'm working on,
you can sign up for my newsletter. As a subscriber, you'll:

- **receive drafts** of content before I publish. If you felt so
  inclined, you could even provide feedback and help shape it 💞.
- **get access to exclusive content** that I don't publish publically.
  Some things are more reflective or personal, so I don't share it
  on my site. However, I'll happily share it with you.
- **take a peak at projects** that I'm working on. When a
  project is in its early stages I don't always open source the
  code right away. However, there's usually a public link somewhere
  I'll share with you so you can play around.

_No spam, ever. You're free to unsubscribe at any time._
